# OddsAndEvens

## This is my second Java project. 

### This project once again makes use of the Java Scanner tool. It once again prompts the user for input, only this time it takes advantage of more complex logic implementations (conditionals and loops). This allows the user to play a game (similar to rock, paper, scissors) with the user.


#### This project provided a deeper dive into more complex logic within the Java programming language
